Bank Account Management Website
This web application simulates basic bank account management functionalities using JavaScript. It allows users to perform three main operations: deposit, withdraw, and check the account balance.

Code Walkthrough
Classes
We created a JavaScript class BankAccount to represent the bank account, which contains properties like accountHolder, accountType, and balance. This class also includes methods for deposit and withdrawal.
Switch Statements
The performTransaction function uses a switch statement to handle different transaction types: deposit, withdraw, and check balance. Depending on the selected type, it calls the respective methods of the BankAccount class.
Try-Catch-Finally Statements
Exception handling is implemented using try-catch blocks. For example, if the user tries to withdraw more money than the account balance, an error message is displayed. The catch block catches exceptions and displays them to the user.
Input Clearing
After each transaction, the input field for the transaction amount is cleared, making it convenient for users to perform subsequent transactions.
This website provides a simple, interactive way to understand and practice JavaScript concepts like classes, switch statements, and error handling while simulating basic bank account management. Feel free to customize and enhance it further according to your needs or for educational purposes.
